      <h1 class="green-expo center">Get to know me!</h1>
      <p>I'm a digital native, nature fanatic, 5k runner, aquarium enthusiast and vinyl collector. I cut my web design teeth
        when I started messing around with HTML, JavaScript, and Photoshop making goofy webpages early in high school.
      </p>
      <p>Fast-forward ten years and a <em>massive</em> amount of learning, and that hobby's turned into my career. 
        I've never had an issue finding a passion in life so much as honing in on just one, and building things for the web scratches the
        most itches: it's creative, people-centric, technical, and just plain fun!

      <h2 class="green-expo">My education and experience:</h2>
      <p>Since 2016, I've been an Adobe certified Web Design Specialist, and have actively maintained proficiency across their suite. 
        <span class="red-highlight">I completed my capstone coursework in the University of Central Florida's web design program last spring, 
        with the team I led's project selected for an expo.</span>

        rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">All American Mobile Detailing</a>,</span> a local startup,
        I went beyond my content and ad campaign responsibilities.</span> I instilled a culture of A/B testing wherever possible, and 
        designed automated CX and marketing flows that saved time and boosted KPIs. <span id="pink-jump" class="pink-highlight">
        My crowning achievement was a data-driven, self-optimizing recruitment process that 
        <em>doubled</em> detailer headcount in our darkest hour.</span></span>

        <h2 class="green-expo">Some ambitions and hobbies:</h2>
        <p><span class="blue-highlight">In a few years, I'd like to go back to school for a master's in Human Computer Interaction.</span> 
          I can also see myself teaching in some capacity in the far future â€” tech is only a bridge to what I love doing most: connecting with people.
        </p>
        <p>Outside work, I definitely like to move! I'm currently training for a half-marathon. I also have a 
          couple road trips with friends in the cards: one by car, one by motorcycle. On weekends, I 
          enjoy keeping outdoors, no matter if it's the beach or a backyard.
