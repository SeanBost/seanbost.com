        <p>While crafting graphics and copy was just a small slice of my work at AAMD, it played a critical role in improving the quality
          of our social media presence, as well as in our customer and detailer retention efforts.

        <p>When I joined AAMD building our reputation was a high priority, with many potential customers questioning our young brand. 
          In addition to driving happy customers to leave reviews, I also introduced a rotating categorical social media content calendar, 
          with a heavy focus on brand building posts.
        </p>
        <p>Regular posts such as this one, tailored to convey authenticity and expertise, would show alongside CTA-oriented copy I'd write. 
          Compared to prior posts, these had notably higher engagement rates, and helped funnel potential customers towards sales.

          <h2 class="blue-expo">Holiday Special Graphics</h2>
          <p>Through analyzing job booking numbers and consulting our sales team, I found our most effective way to sell to previous 
            customers was through limited offer promotions and holidays. I marked every relevant holiday we could target and coordinated 
            lead-up and flash promotions for each.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to holidays, I also created personalized celebratory content, offers, and emails for customers' birthdays
            and detailing aniversaries.

        <h2 class="blue-expo">Generic Content Templating</h2>
        <p>I was often stretched for time, and could not spend much of it on content generation. This lead me to identify and test 
          content patterns and concepts to see how they performed, with an emphasis on engagement and link clicks. Eventually, I was 
          able to build a generic content and brand style guide based on what got results and was easily repeatable. I was then able to 
          consistently make successful graphics rapidly when my hands and time were tied up with higher priority projects.

        <h2 class="red-expo">Automated QA Email Flows</h2>
        <p>As we needed more data on detailer performance yet lacked the resources to follow up on each job over phone, 
          I introduced automated follow-up emails through Mailchimp that collected quantitative and qualitative customer insights.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to aggregating customer responses for internal use, their sentiments either flagged them for a support member to
          reach out and address concerns, or asked them to leave a review and placed them into a targeted marketing email flow I built
          to encourage repeat customers through holiday deals, custom gift card offers, or loyalty incentives.
        </p>
        <p>These sales to preexisting customers via email costed us less than a tenth of what new customers did on average.

        <h2 class="red-expo">Internal Onboarding Materials</h2>
        <p>A key challenge for us was poor detailer retention, especially with newer hires. I was made aware that a popular reason new detailers 
          would leave would be disputes over pay, especially regarding when they would receive their first check and what jobs it would include.
        </p>
        <p>I reached out to our detailer support team, and made this graphic breaking down the admittedly complex detailer pay periods. 
          I then filmed and edited it into an onboarding video along with a brief narrated explanation from our company founder.
        </p>
        <p>We immediately saw a decrease in previously frequent conflicts regarding when a new detailer would get paid, and with the help of 
          other measures, an increase in detailer retention rates overall.
