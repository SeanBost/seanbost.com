            <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #d44; font-size: 350%;">All American Mobile Detailing</h1>
            <p>While my role at AAMD extended far beyond creating content and assets,
                the media I did create working alongside our other teams played an important role in improving our 
                customer experience, sales, brand, and customer & detailer retention.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-left">
            <h2 style="color: #66d;">Automated QA Email Flows</h2>
            <p>As we needed more data on detailer performance yet lacked the resources to follow up each job over phone, 
                I introduced automated follow-up emails through Mailchimp that collected quantitative and qualitative customer insights.</p>
            <p>In addition to aggregating customer responses for internal use, their sentiments either flagged them for a support member to
                contact to address concerns, or asked them to leave a review and placed them into a targeted marketing email flow I built
                to encourage repeat customers through holiday deals or loyalty incentives.
            </p>
            <p>Sales from prior customers via email costed less than a tenth of what new customers did through Google Ads on average.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #66d;">Internal Onboarding Graphic</h2>
            <p>A key challenge for us was poor detailer retention, especially with newer
                hires. One of the primary reasons new detailers 
                would leave would be disputes over pay, specifically when they would receive their first
                check and what jobs it would include.</p>
            <p>To alleviate some confusion, I spoke with our detailer support team, and we conceptualized a few ways we can communicate better. 
                I then made this graphic breaking down the admittedly complex detailer pay periods. I also created and edited it into an onboarding 
                video along with a brief narrated explanation from the company founder.</p>
                <p>We immediately saw a decrease in previously frequent conflicts
                regarding when a new detailer would get paid, and with the help of other measures an increase in detailer retention overall.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-left">
            <h2 style="color: #66d;">Building Customer Confidence Via Social Media</h2>
            <p>When I joined AAMD building our reputation was a high priority, with many pontential customers questioning the authenticity of our brand. 
                In addition to setting up systems to
                improve our CX and to encourage positive reviews, I also
                introduced a categorical social media content calendar, with a heavy focus on brand building posts.</p>
            <p>Regular posts such as this one, tailored to convey trust and expertise, would show alongside CTA-oriented copy I'd write. 
                Compared to prior posts, these had much higher engagement rates and helped
                funnel potential customers towards sales.

            <h2 style="color: #66d;">Holiday Special Graphics</h2>
            <p>Through analyzing our job bookings and consulting our sales team, I uncovered that our most
                effective way sell to existing customers was through limited offer promotions and special
                occasions. I built a marketing calendar with
                lead-up and flash promotions planned for every holiday we could target. In the gaps between holidays I built incentives for gift cards,
                detail anniversaries, and friends-and-family deals.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #66d;">Generic Content Template</h2>
            <p>I was often stretched for time, and could not spend much of it on content
                generation. This lead me to identify and test content patterns and concepts 
                to see how they performed, with an emphasis on engagement and link clicks. Eventually, I was able to build a generic content and
                brand style guide based on what got results and was easily repeatable. I was then able to consistently make successful if generic 
                graphics rapidly when my hands and time were tied up with higher priority projects.</p>

        <div class="content-full" style="margin-top: -30px;">
            <h2 style="color: #d44;">Optimizing Detailer Hiring</h2>
            <p>The winter I started the largest issue we faced was attracting detailing talent with very limited resources.
                We were haphazardly placing hiring ads in various cities without structure.
                I built a spreadsheet with every metro area deemed viable
                along with dates to post hiring ads in them. We cycled through all of them once and our most important targets twice every few weeks.
                This ensured we weren't wasting ads where we had already tapped all talent and weren't
                leaving out any key potential areas for business.</p>
            <p>I also added cells for inputting a metro's application count upon ad closure and for how many of them were viable.
                Formulas automatically determined daily and weekly app totals, average applicant and location quality statistics, and more. 
                I used this data to deprioritize or remove underperforming areas, A/B test different copy and tactics, and iteratively improve our strategies.</p>
            <p>It also let us collect quantitative feedback on how different compensation packages we offered impacted recruitment
                quality and quantity at a regional level. We regularly used this data alongside retention stats to perform cost benefit analyses on various detailer
                compensation measures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-center" style="margin-top: -60px;">
            <p>While most numbers always remained volatile, <b style="color: #d33;">in the span of several months my initiatives had direct impact on doubling the number of detailers in our employment</b>
                and also greatly increased the total areas we served. I also scaled
                our marketing coverage without significant change in our CPA through similar explorative and iterative methods. <b style="color: #d33;">As detailer count directly
                correlated with total revenue, this stabilized our bottom line and provided us with clarity for further growth</b>.</p>
